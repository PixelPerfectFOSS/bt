# üß∞ Banner Toolchain
HTML banner development tools for Node.js. Automate bundling, optimization and packaging of ads, games and other single page web projects. Inspired by and compatible with [SmartHead](https://github.com/smarthead)'s Banny Tools. Based on [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/).

Warning: Banner Toolchain is currently undergoing a major refactoring, so not all existing functionality is ready for use.

* ‚úîÔ∏è Project initialization, custom templates
* ‚úîÔ∏è JavaScript module bundling and babeling
* ‚úîÔ∏è Dev server with file watching and autorefresh
* ‚úîÔ∏è [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) support
* ‚úîÔ∏è CSS animation generator that uses simple [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/)-like input expressions
* ‚åõ Web font generator
* ‚åõ Image minimizer
* ‚åõ Banner builder
* ‚åõ Banner preview tools

## Usage
Installation:
```
npm install
npm link
```

To create a new banner in an empty directory: `bt init`

To run the development server: `bt run`

To build banner for publishing (WIP): `bt build`

## Templates
`bt init` will create a project using a default template that uses [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) animation library. Additionally [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)-based template is available for fully self-hosted banners with as small size overhead as possible:

`bt init anime`

You can also add your own templates to `templates` directory and use them.

## Server tools (WIP)
Development server runs at `http://localhost:8000/`.

Additional utility server runs at `http://localhost:9000/`, providing helper tools and toolchain API, but it is not meant to be accessed directly. Instead, proxy routes from port 8000 should be used to access the tools:
* `http://localhost:8000/preview` - preview page (WIP)
* `http://localhost:8000/fonts` - web font generator (WIP)
* `http://localhost:8000/images` or `http://localhost:8000/tuner` - image minimizer (WIP)
* `http://localhost:8000/mobile` - mobile device emulator to work with Device Orientation API on desktop. This functionality will be reimplemented as a part of `/preview` page in future.
