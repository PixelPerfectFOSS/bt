# üß∞ Banner Toolchain
HTML banner development tools for Node.js. Automate bundling and packaging of animated ads, games and other single page web projects with a focus on size minimization. Inspired by and compatible with [SmartHead](https://github.com/smarthead)'s Banny Tools. Based on [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework.

The main reason I created this was to replace an in-house tool with my own so that I could run old banners and independently start new projects with a compatible layout.

* ‚úîÔ∏è Project initialization, custom templates
* ‚úîÔ∏è JavaScript module bundling and babeling
* ‚úîÔ∏è Dev server with file watching and autorefresh
* ‚úîÔ∏è [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) support
* ‚úîÔ∏è [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) animation support
* ‚úîÔ∏è Built-in simple 3D engine based on WebGL
* ‚úîÔ∏è CSS animation generator that uses simple GreenSock-like input expressions
* ‚úîÔ∏è Capture individual frames of animation of GreenSock banners. Output PNG, layered PSD and animated GIF
* Ô∏è‚úî Capture high-quality MPEG-4 videos of GreenSock banners at 60 fps
* ‚úî Built-in Image Optimizer & Converter - reduce size of PNG, JPEG and SVG images with full control over quality trade-off
* ‚úî Generate inline base64-encoded CSS background-images for fully self-contained banners
* ‚úîÔ∏è Web font generator with subsetting
* ‚åõ Banner Builder
* ‚åõ Banner preview tools: resizer, timer, event manager, device orientation emulator etc.

## Installation
```
npm install
npm link
```

## Basic usage
To create a new banner in an empty directory:

`bt init`

To run the development server:

`bt run`

To build banner for publishing (WIP, relies on a proprietary external tool at the moment):

`bt build <platform>`

where `<platform>` is one of the supported ad platforms (see [platforms.js](https://github.com/gecko0307/bt/blob/master/src/builder/platforms.js) for details).

To capture screenshots of predefined animation frames (for GreenSock template only; dev server should be running):

`bt capture <resolution>`

To capture video (for GreenSock template only; dev server should be running):

`bt capture video <resolution>`

## Templates
`bt init` will create a project using a default template that uses [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) animation library. Additionally [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)-based template is available for fully self-hosted banners with as small size overhead as possible:

`bt init anime`

You can also add your own templates to `templates` directory and use them.

## Server tools (WIP)
Development server runs at `http://localhost:8000/` and serves project's `HTML` directory. Additional services are available at the following routes:
* `http://localhost:8000/preview` - developer's preview page (WIP)
* `http://localhost:8000/fonts` - web font generator
* `http://localhost:8000/images` or `http://localhost:8000/tuner` - image optimizer
* `http://localhost:8000/mobile` - mobile device emulator to work with Device Orientation API on desktop. This functionality will be reimplemented as a part of `/preview` page in future
* `http://localhost:8000/api` - toolchain API (see [src/api.js](https://github.com/gecko0307/bt/blob/master/src/api.js) for details)
* `http://localhost:8000/sse` - server-side events (SSE) interface. Currently provides only file watcher event system which can be used like this: `http://localhost:8000/sse?events=watcher`. These events are emitted when `Fonts` or `Images` directories change
* `http://localhost:8000/file?path=your/path` - retrieves any file relative to project root (a directory where dev server runs)
* `http://localhost:8000/build` - serves `build` directory with latest deploy-ready banner build.
